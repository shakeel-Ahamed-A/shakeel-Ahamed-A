  contents: write **“SHAKEEL AHAMED A”** and a small badge showing **“Profile views 19”**.
- There’s a section heading **“Animations”**.
- Below that, there’s a contributions-style grid area and a green horizontal bar; under it, a broken/missing image link labeled **“3D Contribution Graph”** (indicating the image isn’t loading).
- At the bottom-right, a Windows notification from **Snipping Tool** says the screenshot was copied to clipboard and saved automatically.
